- Basic = tries to play legally and inspects every other player when he is the sheriff.
- Greedy = plays a Basic strategy in odd rounds and tries to add an illegal good in
           even rounds and inspects everyone that does not bribe him when sheriff.
- Bribed = adds as many illegal goods as possible and tries to bribe the sheriff;
